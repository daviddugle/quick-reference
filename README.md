## Particle_Distortion

I generally like the tutorials from the YouTube Chanel Online Tutorials. This one is using a video overlay to achieve the distortion effect. I like it but would rather have done something with CSS. I feel this will be beneficial to me in the future just not sure just quite where as of yet.

## Checkbox

While looking for more cool CSS tutorials to check out I found this checkbox. I really liked how it turned out.

## Navbar

Found a really cool responsive navbar. This was my first exposure to svg and I need to spend some more time on it. The demonstrator did a good job explaining how to use the elements, I just need to dive deeper into svg if I plan on using it. I can see myself using this navbar for future projects. Even if I do not use the SVG I'm certain the concepts will be beneficial.

## FlexNavbar

Can you ever have too many NavBars? I don't think so. Here is a fun one from Skillthrive. I like the different versions that they offered but am probably more partial to the first two.
